# Projects

Faith Forged Studios was founded when Davidalen wanted to provide a Bible study platform that went above and beyond your normal Bible app. After a proof of concept was developed we are taking things to the next level. On this page you will see a quick breakdown of our projects. Stay tuned for new and exciting projects all centered around one thing, God.

## Current Projects

### [The SOAP Dish](/projects/the-soap-dish)

The SOAP Dish is a bible study application at its core. This was the first project we started and since it was originally released in 2022 it has been completly revamped and is currently in the process of yet another full rewrite with tons of new features! For a full break down of The SOAP Dish features visit the projects main page.

### [Faith Hub](/projects/faith-hub)

Faith Hub is in its early stages of the development lifecycle. This idea started after talking with a few different staff members at various churches where all of their day to day operations were being managed in multiple platforms. For example, meetings were scheduled in outlook, rooms were booked in another application, and event registration was in yet another system.
