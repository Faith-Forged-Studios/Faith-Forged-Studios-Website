# The Soap Dish

## Description

The SOAP dish was invisioned while serving as a Middle School small group leader. With the future generations relying more and more on technology we believe that having a digital study aid would be incredibly helpful in reaching the younger generation. The SOAP Dish focues on the bible study method called SOAP which stands for Scripture, Observation, Application and Prayer.

- **S - Scripture**: Identify a specific passage or verse and writing it out by hand or in this case typing it out. This physical act slows you down, helping you focus on every word and allowing the message to settle into your mind.
- **O - Observation**: In this step you look closely at the text to see what is happening. You might ask yourself who is speaking, what the main theme is, or if any words are repeated. The goal is to understand the original context and the facts of the passage.
- **A - Application**: This is the bridge between the Bible and your daily life. You ask, "How does this apply to me today?" You look for a personal takeaway, such as a command to follow, a comfort to hold onto, or a change in attitude you need to make.
- **P - Prayer**: You close the session by talking to God about what you just studied. You can thank Him for the insights, ask for the strength to apply the lesson, or simply pray the verse back to Him as a personal commitment.
